CLVIM: Clematis virginiana (devil's darning needles)

![Clematis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mauricioszabo/clematis/master/doc/clematis.jpg)

Clematis is a NeoVIM package (version >= 4.0, because we're using Floating Windows feature) for Clojure and ClojureScript.
Is an implementation of REPL-Tooling package for NeoVIM

## Installation
You need to have the newest NeoVIM installed. Now, on the official site, they present packages for Ubuntu and Debian, but they're outdated. Use the AppImage.

You also need to have Node.JS installed. Once installed, install the bindings for VIM globally (yeah, not ideal but NeoVIM with Node are not that permissive):

```
$ npm install -g neovim
```

Now you're ready to go!

## What's with the name?

Clematis Virginiana is sometimes abbreviated as CLVIM, which is perfect for the job.

It is also a beautiful name, and a beautiful flower, so be it!

## Disclaimer:
Nothing is working so far. It's still too early to use this plug-in. Contributions are welcome :)
